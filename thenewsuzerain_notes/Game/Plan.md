**Challenge**: How do I make the game interesting to the player while staying realistic? How do I prevent the game from being boring and give the player motivation while not creating a power fantasy?
### [[Choices]]
- all choices have a positive and negative consequence
### [[Story]]
- the gameplay may feel like the player is not getting anywhere due to the zero net gain nature of it so the story needs to captures their attention
- the game should prioritize telling a good story instead of being "fun" e.g. the player should not play the game to snowball and become the greatest country but to react to the events around them while maintaining their vision of what they want to achieve
- events unfold differently every run and the manner which they happen impacts the choices the player has to make so that each run can be different
- negative outcomes everywhere, this universe is not a paradise and better than OTL
### Ideology
- No political ideology is free from evil
- Gameplay starts with the player only being exposed to the positive parts of the regime but the negative parts begin to be revealed as the run progresses
	- show the player a reason why ignorant people would follow this ideology
- Centralized (authoritarian) vs decentralized (democratic) authority: dictators can be benevolent or oppressive or switch from one to the other, democracies can be slow and corruptible
	- Gameplay choice: implementing a post civil war government which could turn on you or make you create a country you are morally opposed to
- Allow crazy people to do crazy, "non-realistic" things but expose the negative consequences from them
### [[Gameplay]]
- expand power bloc
- gain natural resources (OIL)
### Timespan
- short (10-20 years) has complex story
- long (50 years) has many regional conflicts and early player long-term choices influencing the game state
- begins on January 1, 1946, make the WW2 history dates vague because it does not need to make sense since the scenario is unrealistic
### World-building Rules
- the big driver of postwar conflict isn’t “ideology vs. ideology”
- Occupation legitimacy crisis (puppet regimes don’t have it)
- Resource extraction (oil, grain, canals, mines)
- Intra-Axis rivalry (allies become competitors)
- Veterans + weapons + clandestine networks (the war trained everyone)
- [[Conflict Starters]]
### [[Divergences]]
- every Axis defeat becomes a victory
### AI
- Leaders and factions pursue their own goals based on the world situation, as the player you have the advantage of knowing all of their goals and need to pick the least worst/best option in order to steer the country in the direction you want
- picking the same type of choice repeatedly will give your character into that trait e.g. picking aggressive options will make your character belligerent
- allegiances between the great powers fluctuate as mistrust grows and no one wants one power to be more powerful
### Logistics
- make the game moddable, this will increase the lifespan tremendously (see HOI4)
