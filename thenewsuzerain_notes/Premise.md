Balance: How do I make the game interesting to the player while staying realistic?
### Choices matter
- all choices have a positive and negative consequence
### Story-driven
- the gameplay may feel like the player is not getting anywhere due to the zero net gain nature of it so there must be something else which captures their attention
- the game should prioritize telling a good story instead of being "fun" e.g. the player should not play the game to snowball and become the greatest country but to react to the events around them while maintaining their vision of what they want to achieve
- events unfold different every run and the manner which they happen impacts the choices the player has to make so that each run can be different
### Ideology
- No political ideology is free from evil
- Gameplay starts with the player only being exposed to the positive parts of the regime but the negative parts begin to be revealed as the run progresses
	- show the player a reason why ignorant people would follow this ideology
- Centralized (authoritarian) vs decentralized (democratic) authority: dictators can be benevolent or oppressive or switch from one to the other, democracies can be slow and corruptible
	- Gameplay choice: implementing a post civil war government which could turn on you or make you create a country you are morally opposed to
### Player objectives
- expand power bloc
- gain natural resources (OIL)
