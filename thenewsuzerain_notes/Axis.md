The alliance has lost its purpose after the war. [[Germany]] wants tight control, [[Italy]] wants its own Mediterranean empire, [[Hungary]], [[Romania]], [[Slovakia]], [[Croatia]] have territorial grudges. One assassination, leadership death, or economic crash and trigger proxy-backed coups and peacekeeping invasions.

### Inspiration
- Comintern/Cold War coup-proxy logic
- intra-bloc crises like Hungary 1956 and Prague 1968 (mechanism-wise)
- preexisting WW2-era border disputes
