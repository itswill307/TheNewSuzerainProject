A Levant and Mesopotamia oil conflict between client state monarchies and republican/nationalist insurgents. [[Axis]] domination would likely lean on compliant elites to secure oil, pipelines, and bases. That invites nationalist backlash and army coups, urban uprisings, tribal revolts, and pipeline sabotage, often with rival Axis factions backing different sides.  
##### Inspiration
- Iraqi coups (mid-20th century), pipeline politics
- Arab nationalism
- “resource sovereignty” conflicts.
