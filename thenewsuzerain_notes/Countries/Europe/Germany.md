By the end of WW2, Germany has successfully implemented Generalplan Ost by establishing Reichskommissariats in the [[Baltic]], [[Ukraine]], [[Russia]], and the [[Caucasus]]. Germany also established Reichskommissariats across Western Europe in the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Burgundy]], [[France]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[UK]]. The purpose of the Axis has ended and tension with [[Italy]] is growing along the border as both powers struggle to be dominant in Europe. Competition with [[Japan]] is growing in central regions like Central Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. Although the war ended Germany triumphing over the [[USA]], the American continental homeland was untouched and American efforts to supply resistance movements in German conquered territories is ever increasing.
##### Politics
##### Economy
Germany has gained many natural resources and "free" labor but keeping their army mobilizing and working age men away from the workforce is putting strain on the economy. The leader also wants to fund massive projects like Germania and Atlantropa, tying up millions of funds. Germany hopes that local recruits will stay loyal and natural resources will keep flowing from their conquered territories. Demobilizing is also an option but then who is maintaining control over the empire?
