At the end of WW2, Italy has made real gains in growing its Mediterranean empire. The purpose of the Axis has ended and tension with [[Germany]] is growing along the border as both powers struggle to be dominant in Europe. Italian relations with Germany need to be managed very carefully. One small error could lead to a full scale land invasion from the north. The [[USA]] has emerged as a potential ally to combat German influence due to their common goal of prevent further German expansion. [[Japan]] has also been considered as another leverage against Germany but conflicts over the Middle East could cause a rift to form between the two former Axis members.
