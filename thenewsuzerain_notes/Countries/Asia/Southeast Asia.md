Southeast Asia lights up in sequence: [[Vietnam]], [[Malaya]], [[Indonesia]] (each in a different style). [[Japan]]’s wartime promises (“Asia for Asians”) collide with postwar extraction. Local groups that gained arms/training during the war turn on the occupiers or puppet governments. In Vietnam a disciplined independence war that becomes rural insurgency + urban terror + set-piece battles. In Malaya communist-led guerrilla emergency tied to plantations, labor, and ethnic politics. In Indonesia broad nationalist revolution with irregulars, diplomacy, and island-by-island fighting.
