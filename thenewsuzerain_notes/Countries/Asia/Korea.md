Korea becomes means + spark: insurgency, mass strikes, and a border war with a “buffer state”. Korean independence movements would intensify under harsher wartime assimilation. [[Japan]] might respond by militarizing the peninsula, provoking either a large-scale revolt or a neighboring “buffer” conflict if any rival power backs insurgents. Korean insurrectionary groups have the ability for more movement due to Japanese obligations in other conquered territories.

- Korean independence resistance under Japanese rule
- later partition/border-war dynamics as a general model
