An “Indian mutiny of 194X”: mass revolt and defections if [[Japan]] pushes into/controls parts of India. If Japan holds [[Burma]] and pressures India (or occupies eastern regions via proxies), the combination of famine, conscription, and shattered imperial legitimacy can trigger a multi-faction uprising with nationalists, leftists, princely forces fighting with and against each other plus communal violence in the chaos.  
##### Inspiration
- Quit India movement
- INA narrative elements
- Partition-era violence (mechanism: collapsing authority + identity politics)
