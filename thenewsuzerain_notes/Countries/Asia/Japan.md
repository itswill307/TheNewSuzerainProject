At the end of WW2, Japan has asserted itself as the master of Asia through the expansion of its faction the Co-prosperity Sphere and its mantra of "Asia for the Asians" really only refers to themselves as the Asian that will rule Asia. Tensions with the [[USA]] are at an all-time high due to the conquest of the [[Philippines]] and the American Pacific islands, especially Hawaii. If the USA is ever able to grow too strong, Hawaii would be an effective bargaining chip for other concessions. Mistrust with [[Germany]] continues to increase as each side accuses the other of supplying insurrectionary groups. Their southern neighbor [[Italy]] is much more approachable due to their mutual hostility toward Germany. However, conflicts in the oil-rich Middle East are sure to pit the two sides against each other and weigh their personal ambitions against the common threat.
