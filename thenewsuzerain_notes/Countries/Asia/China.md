A rolling civil war between factions of nationalists, communists, warlords, and collaborationists means that conflict in China never stops. Even with [[Japan]] winning WW2, China is too big and politically fractured to pacify. Collaborationist regimes lack legitimacy, resistance forces survive, famine and harsh occupation policies expand recruitment to insurrectionist groups. Japan ends up fighting a semi-permanent counterinsurgency plus periodic conventional flare-ups.
