Turkic republics, Islamic revival movements, and occupier counterinsurgency arise in a fractured [[Russia]] interior and contested Eurasian frontier invites rebellions framed as national liberation and religious revival movements. Germany and Japan would fear open defiance on the border of their empires but may be stretched too thin for meaningful responses. If one power grows strong enough they could respond with harsh security operations, fueling a cycle. The goal of the major powers is to create neutral buffer states or loyal subjects that can infiltrate enemy controlled areas.
##### Inspiration
- Basmachi revolt (1916–30s)
- general frontier-insurgency dynamics
##### [[Germany]]
- restrict arms smuggling and other black market operations into RK Moskowien and RK Kaukasien
- create a buffer against Japan
- create a loyal state as a base to launch operations into the western Japanese sphere
##### [[Japan]]
- restrict arms smuggling and other black market operations into western China
- create a buffer against Germany
- create a loyal state as a base to launch operations into the western German sphere
##### [[USA]]/[[Italy]]
- create chaos to prevent Germany or Japan from stabilizing the region and reaching their goals
- create friendly states to base operations out of and destabilize the German and Japanese spheres
	- much harder to support if Germany or Japan makes a concentrated effort to win
