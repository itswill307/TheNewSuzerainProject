A pan-Maghreb revolt against Italian rule including [[Libya]], [[Tunisia]], [[Algeria]], parts of [[Morocco]]. A North Africa dominated by [[Italy]] would face mass resistance due to land seizures, settler colonial policy, forced labor, and cultural suppression. Veterans of the war return radicalized and organized. The revolt starts localized and becomes a region-wide insurgency.
