At the end of WW2, America is humiliated. The loss of its western European allies the [[UK]] and [[France]] means that the US stands alone against the western advances of [[Germany]] and [[Italy]]. The concession of key strategic pacific islands, including Hawaii, to [[Japan]] means that America has lost its last line of defense to the west. A glimmer of hope lies in the collaborative governments of [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] which could flip from the Japanese side to the American side when the time is right.
